## Annotations:

**Page 119**:
*"Attorneys want you to answer their questions quickly because it means you're not thinking about your answer. You become easier to control and susceptible to having words put in your mouth."*

- This passage reveals how speed in conversation can be used to manipulate. When you're rushed to respond—like in a legal setting—you’re less likely to think critically or choose your words carefully. 
- That makes it easier for others to control the direction of the dialogue or twist your words. Slowing down protects your clarity and helps you stay in control of your message.


**Page 121**:
*"When you're anxious, scared or upset, ...-you talk faster. Its a sign of your ignition phase and it's normal. The increased heart rate speeds up your thought processes, readying you for split-second reactions."*

- This passage explains how emotional stress naturally affects the way we speak. Talking faster when anxious or upset is part of the body’s “ignition phase,” where heightened emotions and a racing heart prepare us for quick reactions. 
- It’s a normal physiological response—but recognizing it can help us pause, slow down, and regain control before our words outrun our intentions.


**Page 123**:
*"There's a sense that silence conveys incompetence, when in reality, silence is wisdom in waiting. It's rushing your words that show weakness. Slowing your words show strength."*

- This passage challenges the common belief that silence means you’re unsure or unprepared. In truth, silence can be a powerful tool—giving space for thought, reflection, and composure.
- Speaking too quickly can signal insecurity, while slowing down shows confidence and control. It reframes silence not as weakness, but as a sign of strength and wisdom.


**Page 124**:
*"...-take the mindset that silence ensures what follows is certain. ...-time to reflect isn't about hesitation-it's about deliberate acknowledgement that you know who you are. Pauses give you the power to choose and decide."*

- This passage reframes silence as a sign of self-assurance, not doubt. Taking time to pause before speaking shows intention and confidence—it means you're choosing your words carefully, not reacting impulsively. 
- Silence becomes a tool for clarity and control, reminding us that thoughtful communication reflects inner certainty and strength.


**Page 134**:
*"A well-times pause credits you with the power of time. Time to reflect, time to reconsider, and time to regulate. 
A short pause of one to four seconds before responding or answering a question makes you sound stronger and more resolute. 
A longer pause of five to ten seconds creates anticipation and serves as a mirror that engages the cooling phase."*

- This passage highlights how intentional pauses can enhance communication. A brief pause gives you time to think and respond with clarity, making you sound more confident and in control. Longer pauses not only build anticipation but also help calm emotions—both yours and the other person’s. 
- Rather than being awkward, silence becomes a strategic tool that invites reflection and deeper connection.


**Page 138**-139:
*"Feelings can't be flipped on like a light switch. Confidence works the same way. Confidence is a feeling. The question isn't 'How do I feel confident?' The question is 'What can I do to create experiences that build my confidence?'
Assertiveness is how you express confidence.
Unlike confidence, which is a feeling, asserting is an action.
Confidence is an inside thing while assertiveness is an outside thing."*

- This passage draws a clear distinction between confidence and assertiveness. Confidence is a feeling that grows over time through experience—it can’t be forced. Assertiveness, on the other hand, is a behavior—it’s how you show confidence through action. 
- While confidence happens internally, assertiveness is how it’s expressed outwardly. This shift in focus—from trying to “feel” confident to taking steps that build it—emphasizes action over emotion and encourages growth through practice.
