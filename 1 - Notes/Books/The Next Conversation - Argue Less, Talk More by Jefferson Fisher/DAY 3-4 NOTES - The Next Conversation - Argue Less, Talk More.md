## Annotations:

**Page 119**:
*"Attorneys want you to answer their questions quickly because it means you're not thinking about your answer. You become easier to control and susceptible to having words put in your mouth."*

- This passage reveals how speed in conversation can be used to manipulate. When you're rushed to respond—like in a legal setting—you’re less likely to think critically or choose your words carefully. 
- That makes it easier for others to control the direction of the dialogue or twist your words. Slowing down protects your clarity and helps you stay in control of your message.


**Page 121**:
*"When you're anxious, scared or upset, ...-you talk faster. Its a sign of your ignition phase and it's normal. The increased heart rate speeds up your thought processes, readying you for split-second reactions."*

- This passage explains how emotional stress naturally affects the way we speak. Talking faster when anxious or upset is part of the body’s “ignition phase,” where heightened emotions and a racing heart prepare us for quick reactions. 
- It’s a normal physiological response—but recognizing it can help us pause, slow down, and regain control before our words outrun our intentions.


**Page 123**:
*"There's a sense that silence conveys incompetence, when in reality, silence is wisdom in waiting. It's rushing your words that show weakness. Slowing your words show strength."*

- This passage challenges the common belief that silence means you’re unsure or unprepared. In truth, silence can be a powerful tool—giving space for thought, reflection, and composure.
- Speaking too quickly can signal insecurity, while slowing down shows confidence and control. It reframes silence not as weakness, but as a sign of strength and wisdom.


**Page 124**:
*"...-take the mindset that silence ensures what follows is certain. ...-time to reflect isn't about hesitation-it's about deliberate acknowledgement that you know who you are. Pauses give you the power to choose and decide."*

- This passage reframes silence as a sign of self-assurance, not doubt. Taking time to pause before speaking shows intention and confidence—it means you're choosing your words carefully, not reacting impulsively. 
- Silence becomes a tool for clarity and control, reminding us that thoughtful communication reflects inner certainty and strength.


**Page 134**:
*"A well-times pause credits you with the power of time. Time to reflect, time to reconsider, and time to regulate. 
A short pause of one to four seconds before responding or answering a question makes you sound stronger and more resolute. 
A longer pause of five to ten seconds creates anticipation and serves as a mirror that engages the cooling phase."*

- This passage highlights how intentional pauses can enhance communication. A brief pause gives you time to think and respond with clarity, making you sound more confident and in control. Longer pauses not only build anticipation but also help calm emotions—both yours and the other person’s. 
- Rather than being awkward, silence becomes a strategic tool that invites reflection and deeper connection.


**Page 138**-139:
*"Feelings can't be flipped on like a light switch. Confidence works the same way. Confidence is a feeling. The question isn't 'How do I feel confident?' The question is 'What can I do to create experiences that build my confidence?'
Assertiveness is how you express confidence.
Unlike confidence, which is a feeling, asserting is an action.
Confidence is an inside thing while assertiveness is an outside thing."*

- This passage draws a clear distinction between confidence and assertiveness. Confidence is a feeling that grows over time through experience—it can’t be forced. Assertiveness, on the other hand, is a behavior—it’s how you show confidence through action. 
- While confidence happens internally, assertiveness is how it’s expressed outwardly. This shift in focus—from trying to “feel” confident to taking steps that build it—emphasizes action over emotion and encourages growth through practice.

*" 10 Ways to Practice Assertiveness Now:**
1.Every word matters:
	Investing in your words and phrasing is investing in your future self-your self esteem and the person you want to be.
	Ex. Unsure: 'I'm sort of wondering if I should maybe ask the team'.
	**Assertive**: 'I'll ask the team' 
	Unsure: 'I guess I'm looking for a bit more clarity on your expectations.
	**Assertive**: 'I need more clarity on your expectations' 
2.Prove it to yourself:
	 Ex. 'I'm moving forward from this conversation'
	 Ex. 'I'm asking for your permission'
	 Ex. 'I'm setting a reminder' 
	 Ex. 'Please see attached' 
	 Take back control with assertive language and lean in. Tell them what you are going to do, then do it.
3.Express your needs unapologetically
	Ex. 'I won't accept that'
	Ex. 'I want fair expectations'
	Ex. 'I need assurance that this won't happen again.'
	Ex. 'I need a moment'
	Ex. 'I need to speak with you'
	Ex. 'I need you to know how this affected me'
	Ex. 'I need your help'
	Do not litter your needs with 'I'm sorry'
	Ex. Before: 'Sorry I'm late'. After: 'Thank you for your patience' (unless you are really late, in which case you should apologize)
	Ex. Before: 'Sorry to bother you'. After: 'I appreciate your help'. 
4.Speak when it matters:
	The more this person spoke, the more respect and credibility they lost. The most valued senior partner, however, hardly spoke. One of the biggest separators between those who show confidence and those who don't is how often they feel the need to say something. ...-insecure people often have the urge to say everything. ...-insecurity convinces them that they have everything to prove. This insecurity manifests in apparent ways: name-dropping, one-upping, or an insistence on having the last word. Confident people have the urge to say nothing. There is wisdom in their silence. They are listening, observing, absorbing.
5.Say less:
	Over-explaining kills confidence. The more words you use, the less you actually say.
6.Remove filler words: 
	You know them as the ums, ahs, and uhs that delay your speed. Or filler words such as 'like', 'you know', 'you know what I mean?', 'Right' or 'I know, right', 'So, yeah'.
	Instead, simply replace your fillers with silence.
7.Never undersell:
	Using phrases that undervalue your worth will slowly eat away at your confidence. Phrases like:
	'I hate to bother you'
	'I know this might sound stupid'
	'Forgive me for this dumb question'
	'I'm probably missing something here'
	'You probably know better than me'
	...-the signal you're sending is that you see yourself as less. So instead, focus on phrasing that builds upon or breaks down the issue being raised. For example:
	'I'd like to build upon what you said'
	'I'd like to dig a bit deeper'
	'Can I take that a bit further'
	'I have some insight that might add value here'
8.Cut the excess:
	One of the quickest ways to boost your assertive vocabulary is to cut the adverbs from your sentences. ...-they're just fine in casual conversation. 
	A lot of other phrases clutter your assertiveness. Such as:
	'What I'm saying is...' or 'All I'm saying is...'
	'I just find it funny how'
	'No offense, but'
	'It's just that'
	'I mean...'
	'I just need to say...'
	'To be honest'
	'Don't take this the wrong way'
	'I just really'
	'I'm just curious'
	'So I'm thinking maybe like'
9.When in doubt, fall back on experience:
	Ex. 'I haven't come across this before'
	'In my experience...'
	'In the past, I've...'
	'From what I've seen...' 
10.Say 'I'm confident':
	Before: 'I think my skills will be an asset to your company'
	After: 'I'm confident my skills will be an asset to your company'
	Before: 'I believe I can help'
	After: 'I am confident I can help'
	Before: 'I guess if I have questions, I know where to look'
	After: 'I'm confident that if I have questions, I know where to look'
	Instead of saying 'I think' say 'I'm confident' "*

- I deeply resonate with lessons 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. I believe that a lot of my insecurity and my inability to maintain truly deep relationships and connections comes from the words and the way I carry myself with my words. These lessons really changed my outlook a lot on my own insecurities I have with the person since all the ways of how insecure people speak, I admittedly do. The fall outs I have had with friends in my life, with people I love or I am close too stem from the carrying of insecurity I have on myself, and it all starts with how I subconsciously use my words as shown in this annotation. 


**Page 159**:
*"To sound more confident, end you sentences with a downward or neutral inflection."*

- Ending your sentences with a downward or neutral tone signals confidence and certainty. An upward inflection—like when you end a sentence sounding like a question—can make you seem unsure, even if your words are clear. 
- By being mindful of your tone, you reinforce that you stand by what you're saying, which helps others take you more seriously.



## Summary:

Days 3 and 4 of _The Next Conversation_ explore the nuanced art of assertive communication, highlighting how silence, pacing, and intentional language can redefine confidence in dialogue. The book begins by showing how rapid responses—especially in high-pressure situations—make us more susceptible to manipulation and misunderstanding. Speaking slowly and pausing with intention not only offers clarity but also communicates calm authority. Contrary to popular belief, silence is not a sign of weakness; it is often wisdom in disguise.

This section also distinguishes between **confidence** and **assertiveness**. Confidence is an inner feeling that builds with experience, while assertiveness is the external behavior that reflects that internal state. The focus shifts from trying to “feel” confident to developing consistent habits that project it—through language, tone, and deliberate action.

A central highlight is the **“10 Ways to Practice Assertiveness Now”**—a practical guide to transforming passive or insecure language into clear, grounded communication. It stresses the importance of:

- Choosing precise words and avoiding over-explaining
    
- Eliminating filler language and insecure qualifiers
    
- Reframing apologies into appreciation
    
- Speaking less, but with more intention
    
- Using personal experience to bolster credibility
    
- Ending sentences with **downward or neutral inflection** to project certainty
    

For the author—and for the reader doing the reflection—this becomes more than technique; it’s a mirror into how insecurity has shaped past relationships and self-expression. Real change begins not in louder speech, but in mindful, measured dialogue that aligns with inner values.

Ultimately, this section of the book reminds us that confident communication is less about being loud and more about being **clear**, **grounded**, and **purposeful**—and that with every word, we either strengthen or weaken the story we’re telling about ourselves.
