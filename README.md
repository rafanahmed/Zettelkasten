# Zettelkasten Notes

This is my personal Zettelkasten — a collection of notes, ideas, and connections I’ve built over time. It’s a way for me to document how I think, what I’m learning, and how my perspective evolves.

I’m using this space as a digital record of my journey into more intentional note-taking. It’s not perfect, and it’s not supposed to be. I update it when I feel like it, and I treat it more like a process than a project.

## Why this exists

I wanted a simple, flexible way to track what I’m thinking and learning. Writing helps me slow down and figure things out. Over time, the goal is to build a network of ideas instead of isolated notes.

## How it’s organized

The notes are written in Markdown and managed with Obsidian. They’re loosely structured and mostly follow a loose Zettelkasten approach. Some notes are raw, some are refined. That’s intentional.

## If you're curious

This repo is public because I believe in learning in the open. You won’t find polished blog posts or tutorials here. Just thoughts in motion.
